# Go Pill
Go Pill aims to guide people through their pill taking process.

## About
This is a mobile application where people can be reminded when they need to take their needed medication and when they should consider getting a refill based on how many pills the user has left. We provide users with an in-app schedule where they can introduce their medicine. Our app also offers a drug search feature where users can find all the pharmacies that have that medicine in stock and filter the results by convenience in terms of price and geography.

This project was developed during the **Technovation** challenge.
